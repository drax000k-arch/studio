/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Advisify AI application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user data, decision scenarios, and decision options.
 * Comments are stored in a top-level collection and are publicly accessible.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles. Accessible only by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/decisionScenarios/{decisionScenarioId}: Stores decision scenarios created by the user. Accessible only by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/decisionScenarios/{decisionScenarioId}/options/{decisionOptionId}: Stores decision options. Accessible only by the user.
 * - /comments/{commentId}: Stores comments on decision scenarios. Accessible by anyone, but creation and deletion are restricted.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data (users collection, decision scenarios, and options).
 * - Public listing of user documents is disallowed.
 * - Comments are publicly readable, but creating a comment requires a valid user ID.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - Comments contain the userId of the author, enabling creator-based access control.
 *  - Comments contain the scenarioId of the related DecisionScenario, enabling rule validation.
