/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles and decisions,
 *              and allows public read access to community posts with owner-only write access.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores public user profile information, accessible only to the user.
 * - /community-posts/{postId}: Stores community posts, publicly readable but writable only by the post author.
 * - /users/{userId}/decisions/{decisionId}: Stores user-specific decisions, accessible only to the user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - Community posts are publicly readable, but only the author can create, update, or delete them.  The author's `uid` must match `request.auth.uid` on creation.
 * - Users can only read, create, update, and delete their own decisions.
 * - Listing of users is disallowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `CommunityPost` entity requires an `author.uid` field to determine ownership for write operations. This avoids costly `get()` calls to a separate `/users/{userId}` document.
